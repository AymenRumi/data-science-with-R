### Data Visualization <a name="dv"></a>

Sample Visualizations:

  * Goal of visualization is to identify relationships between the predictor variables (x1,x2,x3,....) and the response (y)

### Hyperparameter Tuning:
  * Used to identify hyperamater for models for best performance under K-Fold cross validation error
  
### Residual Analysis:
  * Used to identify normality assumption of errors terms, signifies model captures proper variablity of response ~y
